# Gistpad-Feedback

**Initial thoughts**

Wow! This does so much. Where do I start?!

**No sign in feedback?**

When I signed in and pasted my token, hit enter, there was no notification saying, "Success!"

**Create repository?**

I was looking for a "GistPad: Create New Repository" only to find it under "Manage Repository"

Also, I don't know if you could do this, but when I create a repository, it would be awesome if you:

- created a new directory on my local machine with repo name
- added a basic README

I did find the clone repo from url and that worked.

**Link to page that doesn't exist**

Oh no! I tried to link to a nonexistent page and got this error when cmd + clicking. In Foam, this will create the page if it doesn't exist.

**How to save comments?**

I see that I can comment, but I'm not sure how to save it or add it?

**Configure Daily Page heading format**

I prefer Month, Day Year (July 15, 2020). It would be nice to configure this in the GistPad Settings (we added this for Foam I believe).

**Autocomplete of existing pages**

I wonder if I had some setting on but for some reason I couldn't get it to autocomplete my pages after typing "[[". You can see my 


**Graph?**

I think this is the only major knowledge base feature I didn't see? (maybe it's in the works). But in Obsidian, Roam, Foam, you have a knowledge graph showing the nodes and their connections. The one in Foam isn't perfect AFAIK, but I think we're working on it.

**Amazed**

I am seriously amazed at all the features GistPad has and the number of things you could use it for. I could build a whole course on "Mastering GistPad for VS Code" ðŸ˜‚ Or even "GistPad for Technical Teachers" and talk about using it for code samples, at least frontend stuff. I didn't play around with it enough to know if the playground for other languages (Rust, Reason, etc.)
